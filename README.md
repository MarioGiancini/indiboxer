==============================

To setup open the project folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` or `foundation start` if Foundation cli is in stalled to run Gulp. The built game will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:
